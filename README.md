"# LivPoll" 
 A prototype made as a solution to make voting easier.
(Currently set up with indian apis)

The apk provides an app solution to check nearby polling stations, your voting info thorugh epic number or phone number (currently being implemented) with extra function to navigate to nearby polling station as well.
User can check the polling station assigned to him/her via their epic/phone number.
If backend is implemented with a camera on a polling station, it can be used to send live data of people currently in queue in that station to the user so they can schedule when to go accordingly and better plan thier visit saving time and money.

Since its in a prototype stage, the python script for backend can be just ran with a web cam, and app will be able to read the data from it assuming both places have internet access to access firebase backend (real time data base).
